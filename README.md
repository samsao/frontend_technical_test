# Samsao's Reporter

Your mission, if you accept it, is to list all public repositories of the
Samsao's organization on GitHub.

For this task, your objective is to create a website containing, in a list
form, all the Samsao's public repositories on GitHub. Each row must display
the repository full name and last update time at least. The list of repositories
must be dynamically retrieved from GitHub API.

Each row must be clickable, and once clicked, it must display extra information:

 * Language
 * Default branch
 * Forks count

The exact way of presenting this extra information is left to you, it can be
an expandable layout, a dedicated page (navigation), a dialog or something
completely different.

## Guidelines

Write the code to be production-grade. You are free to use whether framework or
library you want. The only constraints is that you use a frontend programming
language (JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.) and that your project has styling via
CSS. While it doesn't need to have an extravagant UI styling, we still want to
see some of your CSS skills.

Once finish, zip your finished project and send it back to the interviewer that
sent you the initial instructions. As zip files are restricted via email, name
your zip archive `<firstname_lastname>.zip.other` (for example, `john_doe.zip.other`)
so that scan process does not reject your email. An acknowledgment will be sent
to you after reception if everything is all right.

**Do not** send pull request on the repository.
